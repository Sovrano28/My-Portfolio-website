        <h5>my quick story</h5>
        <p>
           I have always - you may say - been obsessed (in a positive way) <strong>about anything tech</strong>. Somehow my Grandpa could testify to this. "Ayokanmi must be an engineer," he would say repeatedly. You may say, "that's how grannies do anyways." Well, as a kid I was always seen looking and checking anything that could puzzle my inquisitive mind. You wouldn't see me anywhere but my uncle's room, putting my hands over every single appliances that is not breathing life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe that's why I wouldn't watch any movies except the ones they repeatedly use the word 'quantum' without restraint. <span class="text-margin-left">
            Growing up, <strong>learning and creating have been at the core of my heart.</strong> I have been involved in music, acting and so on.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>In the last few years,</strong> I have been increasingly working on websites, softwares and programs in general. I have been lucky to have worked alongside passionate developers, designers and mentors whose hunger and professionalism have definitely rubbed off on me.

        <h5>as a developer</h5>
        <p>
          There was this passion my first encounter with a python code ignited in me. Although, it was just for solving something as simple as a simultaneous equation, but that for me was the <strong>beginning of it all</strong>. I started trying some <strong>python GUI's like Tkinter and PySimpleGUI</strong>
           to make my simple engineering-problem solving codes become interactive. But of course, these tools were really limited and which was how 
           I got to know about HTML and CSS. And being a graphic designer I just fell in love with the infinite artistic designs and UI that's possible 
           with HTML, CSS and increasing number of frontend frameworks and libraries.

        <h5>as a person</h5>
        <p>
          <strong>Resourceful</strong> and <strong>inquisitive</strong>, that's how I'll describe myself in words. To also add, the thirst to see the end of a problem alongside <strong>creativity</strong> is how I sail through obstacles. I can't seem to stress this enough, <strong>I am curious by nature and love learning</strong>, and so I have a wide range amassed of skills and interest that when put together, end up feeding my career in one way or another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just so you know, I have this strange love for accents, dialects and languages in general. Although, ironically only speak three languages fluently (for now).
